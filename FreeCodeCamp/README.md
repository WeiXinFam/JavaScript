- variables:
  - store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself.
  - JavaScript variables when declared, it has an inital value of `undefined`
- keyword:
  - var
  - let
- note:
  - JS variables and function names are case sensitive. Best Practice is camelCase
  - Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors.
- operators:
  - `+`
  - `-`
  - `*`
  - `/`
  - `%`
    - The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.
- increment/decrement:

  - `i++ == i=i+1`
  - `i-- == i=i-1`
  - `i+=5 == i=i+5`
  - `i-=5 == i= i-5`
  - `i*=5 == i=i*5`
  - `i/=5 == i= i/5`

- string operations:
  - use backslash(\)
    - to escape quote
      - or declare the new string with single quote at the beginning and at the end, with the other conversation string as double quotes
    - to escape character
  - can use single or double quotes
  - escape sequences in string
    - `\'` single quote
    - `\"` double qupte
    - `\\` backslash
    - `\n` newline
    - `\r` carriage return
    - `\t` tab
    - `\b` word boundary
    - `\f` form feed
